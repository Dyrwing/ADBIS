                            <p>Not all studies require participants to have a psychiatric diagnosis. Some research projects are looking for individuals with specific mental health conditions, while others need participants without any diagnosis to serve as a comparison group. Some studies may focus on general population experiences related to mental well-being, stress, or daily functioning. Each project clearly states its specific requirements.</p>

                            <p>This depends on the specific study. Some studies exclude participants on certain medications because they may affect the outcomes being measured, while others specifically focus on individuals taking particular treatments. In many observational studies, medication use is permitted. The eligibility criteria will specify any medication restrictions, and the research team will review your current medications during the screening process.</p>

Typically, de-identified data is retained for a specified period (often 5-10 years) to allow for verification of findings if needed. You'll be informed during the consent process about how long your data will be kept and whether it might be used for future research. In some cases, you may be asked if your data can be included in a database for future studies, but this is always optional.</p>
